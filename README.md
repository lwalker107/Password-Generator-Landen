## Tutor Help

For this assignment, lines 101-105 I used this article on how to randomize the characters in the list for the password generation since I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to do this. The link (dev.to/code_mystery/random-password-generator-using-javascript-6a). I also got help from Ask.BCS on how the logic worked on those lines as well (got help from Sebastian).
